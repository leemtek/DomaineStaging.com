              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p><em>“I was truly impressed by Marcyne's professionalism and expertise in project management.  As a client living abroad, Marcyne and her team made the staging process complete carefree.  She partnered with our real estate agent and association to coordinate the consultation, move in, staging and move out.  After sitting on the market for over 6 months, our luxury condo sold in a matter of weeks, in a still difficult market, after using Domaine Staging.  I recommend Marcyne to anyone in the Charlotte area looking to sell their home.” 
                </em><br />

              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>                <em>“We got 2 offers on our house within about a week of putting it on the market!  The best offer was $173,000.  List price for the house was $170,000. Thanks for the beautiful staging -- we especially loved the virtual tour!”</em><br />
                &#8212; S. Salvador, 
              Dec 2011</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p> <em>“It is a sincere pleasure working with Marcyne and Cathy at Domaine Staging.  They know how to help sellers understand the importance of staging a home, and that translates into higher contract prices and shorter days on market every time.  Today's buyers purchase move-in ready homes beautifully conditioned.  Domaine Staging's professional team of designers, stagers, and contractors help me get more properties sold in less time, with much happier sellers and buyers as a result. I highly recommend Domaine Staging!”</em><br />

              <p> <em>&quot;Had multiple offers and we contracted ABOVE LISTING PRICE.  Under Contract in 11 days in! You guys rock!&quot; (re: West Glenview Drive staging)</em><br />

              <p> <em>“9 showings in the 12 days that it's been on the market and under Contract DAY 12! THANK YOU!!!”</em><br />

              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p> <em>“After eight unsuccessful months of trying to sell our house, we finally decided to have our home staged.  Seven days after the staging our house was under contract!  Domaine was great to work with and the house looked great!  Thank you to Marcyne and all of the Domaine Staging team for your hard work.”</em><br />
                &#8212; Steve and Allison, homeowners, 
              January 2012</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p><em>“Thank you for your very able assistance in staging my home recently. In this difficult residential market, your professionalism and creativity resulted in the sale of my home in just a matter of weeks! We had numerous compliments on your staging from both prospective buyers and real estate brokers. I will highly recommend you to my friends and associates who are planning to sell their homes.”</em><br />
                &#8212; Bob, homeowner, May 2012</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p> <em>“Marcyne of Domaine Staging makes the dramatic difference. Any realtor will tell you that all factors being equal a staged property blows the other way out. Houses that show will because of staging even sell better than a superior house that is not stated. Because I work with a discriminating seller I knew that Domaine Staging was perfect for the task. I interviewed upwards of six stagers and Marcyne has the best communication skills, friendliest demeanor and kindest personality. In the stressful real estate business it’s so assuring and comforting to know that I can relax when working with Marcyne and her assistant because they are professional, congenial and talented.”</em><br />

              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p><em>“Just want to thank you for doing a fabulous job on staging our home. It looked beautiful and everyone who came to see it was totally impressed with your talent … with your staging, it was like a different home. I was skeptical at first, but my husband wanted to see what your staging could do to help sell our home. WOW! I was so pleased … Domaine Staging was what made our home sell so quickly, especially in this housing market. Thank you again and I will definitely use you again.”</em><br />

              <p><em>&quot;10 days on market. Listed at $320,000 sold for $305,000. Highest sales price in the neighborhood! Wonderful staging, it really highlighted the young fun feel of the house&quot;</em>. <br />
