           		<h2>FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS</h2>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><strong>What is the process for staging my home?</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>We will meet with you to discuss your needs and expectations.&nbsp;We take detailed notes, photographs, and document every aspect of your home. </li>
              <li>After further research, your Accredited Staging Professional (ASP&trade;)/Accredited Staging Professional Master (ASPM&trade;) will present you with a Bid .&nbsp;After the paperwork is completed, we will discuss the steps to be accomplished before your Staging&reg; can begin.</li>
              <li>The day of the Staging&reg; is an exciting one!&nbsp;While you are away at work or play, our team will come into your house and transform it into a home where any buyer can imagine living.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
		          <p><strong>What is a consultation service?</strong><br>
		            To minimize costs, many homeowners want to do the bulk of the work themselves.&nbsp;A consultation service is also available.&nbsp;We come to your home and discuss what can be completed to maximize the selling features.&nbsp;We take pictures and meticulous notes which we present to you to complete the Staging&reg;.&nbsp;Payment is required at the time of service.&nbsp;</p>
		          <p>We will return to your home to certify that it qualifies for placement on the Staged Homes&trade; website so that it will receive maximum exposure in the market.</p>
		          <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><strong>When should I Stage&reg; my home?</strong><br>
          If you&rsquo;re planning to sell your home, now is the time!  It may take time to prepare your home for sale at the best price. </p>
		        <p> If your house has been on the market for several months, NOW is the time.  Many homes that have been on the market for three months to a year have sold in less than one week after being staged. <a href="http://www.stagedhomes.com/public/statistics.php" target="_blank">Click here</a> to see statistics from Staged Homes website.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
		        <p><strong>I spent a lot of money on a Decorator.  Why do I need Staging&reg;?</strong><br>
          Staging&reg; is not decorating.  Decorating involves personalizing a space; Staging&reg; is neutralizing it.  We want to appeal to the LARGEST audience.  We know how to maximize the key selling points and living areas.  For large, open-space areas, we have expertise defining appropriate uses.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
		        <p> <strong>How much does this cost?  Will I be pressured into spending a lot of money?</strong><br>
          The cost of Staging&reg; is less than the cost of your first price reduction!  The idea of home staging is to transform your house to appeal to most buyers and sell quickly for top dollar. We will suggest using a rental furniture company only when absolutely necessary.  For a vacant home, it&rsquo;s a must.  If rental is desired, we will take care of the details such as picking out all necessary items and arranging the delivery schedule.  Domaine Staging&reg; offers a large inventory of accessories and accent pieces. </p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
	        <p><strong>I live in an area where houses sell quickly. Would I still benefit from Staging&reg;?</strong><br>
          YES!  You will benefit more.  Staging when the real estate market is hot makes your house more competitive.  When buyers are paying full asking price for a home that is lack-luster, just imagine what the buyers will pay for a house that is Staged&reg;!</p>
