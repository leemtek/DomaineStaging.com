  <p><strong>Real estate in the last five years has changed. Have you? </strong></p>
  <p>RainCamp is an event unlike anything you have ever experienced in your life. You are a member of ActiveRain, the largest and most successful social media company for real estate professionals in the world. We have grown 100% by word of mouth and referrals. </p>
  <p>We are the experts in social media and blogging and we are bringing RainCamp to Charlotte on Thursday, October 28th to share our knowledge with you.</p>
  <p>Give us one day to show you how to use social media and cutting edge tools to take it to the next level. After RainCamp I guarantee you will have the tools to revolutionize your business.  </p>
  <p><strong>At RainCamp:  </strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>We will not tell you that you need to get more listings - we will show you a step by step listing presentation that has yielded our speaker a 95% success on obtaining the listing. </li>
    <li>We will not tell you that you need a business page on Facebook - we will show you how to create one. </li>
    <li>We will not explain that Facebook drives traffic and that you need to be involved - wewill show you how to optimize a Facebook click campaign to drive business to your website. </li>
    <li>We will not tell you how much business blogging has generated - we will show you real blogs that have generated six figures for agents. </li>
    <li>We will not tell you that you “need to start blogging” (like they all do) - we will teach you how to write a blog post and get it to the first page of Google in minutes (is that possible?). </li>
    <li>We will not have speakers tell you how successful they are or “were” - they will teach you what they know and how they did it. </li>
    <li>We will not tell you about how a website on page one of Google can get you business - we will show you how to search engine optimize your website so that your site ranks on page one for many real estate search terms. </li>
    <li>We will not say you need to call your internet leads - we will give you a 10 step process that has yielded the best results we have found.</li>
  </ul>
